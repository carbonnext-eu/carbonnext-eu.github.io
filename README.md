## EU CO and CO2 emissions and chemical parks
Data based on [CarbonNext](http://carbonnext.eu/) project.

The emissions come from the [E-PRTR](http://prtr.ec.europa.eu). Some data was changed on the request of the emitting companies (notably the Austrian cement, lime and plaster industry) without impact on the significance of the displayed data.

The maps are &copy; [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright), &copy; [CARTO](https://carto.com/attribution)

Chemical parks have been compiled within the project, mainly based on https://chemicalparks.eu.

## Explanations
The live website uses a pre-calculated potentials json which needs to be updated when updating the csv files!
